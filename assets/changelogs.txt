*** As requested by many users, the "Download" feature has been implemented to support offline play.
Songs added to My Songs will be automatically downloaded. Turn this auto-download feature off in menu Settings.
- To download songs already added in My Songs, press and hold for more options.
- When playing a song, the app checks if the song was downloaded before. If it was, the app will play from sdcard, or streaming from the internet otherwise.

*** Enjoy and give some feedback!
